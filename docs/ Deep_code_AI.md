To write a Deep Code for AI library in Python, you can use the following steps:

1. Import the necessary modules.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
```

2. Define a class to represent a Deep Code for AI model.

This class will contain the code for training and evaluating the model, as well as the code for making predictions.

```python
class DeepCodeForAIModel:
  def __init__(self):
    self.model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(1000,)),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

  def train(self, X, y):
    self.model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                      loss='binary_crossentropy',
                      metrics=['accuracy'])
    self.model.fit(X, y, epochs=10)

  def evaluate(self, X, y):
    loss, accuracy = self.model.evaluate(X, y)
    return loss, accuracy

  def predict(self, X):
    predictions = self.model.predict(X)
    return predictions
```

3. Use the DeepCodeForAIModel class to train and evaluate a model.

```python
# Load the training and test data.
X_train, y_train = np.load('train.npz')
X_test, y_test = np.load('test.npz')

# Create a DeepCodeForAIModel object.
model = DeepCodeForAIModel()

# Train the model.
model.train(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model.
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)

# Print the evaluation results.
print('Loss:', loss)
print('Accuracy:', accuracy)
```

4. Use the DeepCodeForAIModel class to make predictions on new data.

```python
# Load the new data.
X_new = np.load('new.npz')

# Make predictions on the new data.
predictions = model.predict(X_new)

# Print the predictions.
print(predictions)
```

This is a simple example of a Deep Code for AI library in Python. You can extend this library to include more features, such as support for different types of data and different types of models. You can also use this library to implement more advanced features, such as hyperparameter tuning and transfer learning.

There are also a number of third-party Deep Code for AI libraries available for Python. Some of the most popular libraries include:

* **TensorFlow Model Garden:** TensorFlow Model Garden is a library that provides access to a variety of pre-trained Deep Code for AI models.
* **PyTorch Hub:** PyTorch Hub is a library that provides access to a variety of pre-trained Deep Code for AI models.
* **Hugging Face Transformers:** Hugging Face Transformers is a library that provides access to a variety of pre-trained Deep Code for AI models for natural language processing.

You can use one of these third-party libraries instead of writing your own Deep Code for AI library.
