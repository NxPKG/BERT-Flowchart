To write the error detection feature in Python, you can use the following steps:

    Import the necessary modules.

Python

import sys
import traceback

Use code with caution. Learn more

    Define a function to handle errors.

This function will take the error message and stack trace as input and log the error to the console.
Python

def handle_error(error_message, stack_trace):
  """Logs an error to the console.

  Args:
    error_message: The error message.
    stack_trace: The stack trace.
  """

  print(f"Error: {error_message}")
  traceback.print_exc()

Use code with caution. Learn more

    Wrap your code in a try-except block.

This will catch any errors that occur in your code and call the handle_error() function to log the error.
Python

try:
  # Your code here
except Exception as e:
  handle_error(str(e), sys.exc_info()[2])

Use code with caution. Learn more

    Use the traceback module to get the stack trace of the error.

The stack trace is a list of function calls that led to the error. This information can be helpful for debugging the error.
Python

stack_trace = sys.exc_info()[2]

Use code with caution. Learn more

    Log the error to a file or database.

In addition to logging the error to the console, you may also want to log it to a file or database. This will allow you to track errors over time and to identify trends.
Python

# Log the error to a file.
with open("errors.log", "a") as f:
  f.write(f"Error: {error_message}\n")
  f.write(traceback.format_exc())

# Log the error to a database.
# ...

Here is an example of a simple Python program that uses the error detection feature:
Python

import sys
import traceback

def handle_error(error_message, stack_trace):
  """Logs an error to the console.

  Args:
    error_message: The error message.
    stack_trace: The stack trace.
  """

  print(f"Error: {error_message}")
  traceback.print_exc()

try:
  # Code that may generate an error
  print(1 / 0)
except Exception as e:
  handle_error(str(e), sys.exc_info()[2])

Use code with caution. Learn more

Output:

Error: division by zero
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "error_detection.py", line 10, in <module>
    print(1 / 0)
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
