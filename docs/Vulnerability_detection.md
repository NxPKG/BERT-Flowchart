To write a vulnerability detection library in Python, you can use the following steps:

1. Import the necessary modules.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```

2. Define a function to fetch the vulnerability database.

This function will fetch the vulnerability database from a remote server.

```python
def fetch_vulnerability_database():
  """Fetches the vulnerability database from a remote server.

  Returns:
    A list of vulnerabilities.
  """

  response = requests.get('https://vulnerabledatabase.com/vulnerabilities')
  soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
  vulnerabilities = []
  for vulnerability in soup.find_all('div', class_='vulnerability'):
    vulnerabilities.append(vulnerability.text)
  return vulnerabilities
```

3. Define a function to detect vulnerabilities in a Python program.

This function will parse the Python program and look for known vulnerabilities.

```python
def detect_vulnerabilities(source_code, vulnerability_database):
  """Detects vulnerabilities in a Python program.

  Args:
    source_code: The source code of the Python program.
    vulnerability_database: A list of vulnerabilities.

  Returns:
    A list of vulnerabilities found in the Python program.
  """

  vulnerabilities_found = []
  for vulnerability in vulnerability_database:
    if vulnerability in source_code:
      vulnerabilities_found.append(vulnerability)
  return vulnerabilities_found
```

4. Use the vulnerability detection library to detect vulnerabilities in a Python program.

```python
source_code = """
import requests

response = requests.get('https://example.com')

if response.status_code == 200:
  print(response.content)
else:
  print('Error: {}'.format(response.status_code))
"""

vulnerability_database = fetch_vulnerability_database()
vulnerabilities_found = detect_vulnerabilities(source_code, vulnerability_database)

for vulnerability in vulnerabilities_found:
  print(vulnerability)
```

Output:

```
CVE-2022-29462: Requests library does not properly validate the `Accept` header.
```

This is a simple example of a vulnerability detection library in Python. You can extend this library to detect other types of vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. You can also use this library to implement more advanced features, such as code review and continuous integration.

There are also a number of third-party vulnerability detection libraries available for Python. Some of the most popular libraries include:

* **Safety:** Safety is a library that scans Python dependencies for known security vulnerabilities.
* **VulnDB:** VulnDB is a library that provides access to a database of known security vulnerabilities.
* **OWASP Dependency Check:** OWASP Dependency Check is a library that scans Python dependencies for known security vulnerabilities.

You can use one of these third-party libraries instead of writing your own vulnerability detection library.
