To write a programming knowledge library in Python, you can use the following steps:

1. Import the necessary modules.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from collections import defaultdict
```

2. Define a function to fetch the programming knowledge database.

This function will fetch the programming knowledge database from a remote server.

```python
def fetch_programming_knowledge_database():
  """Fetches the programming knowledge database from a remote server.

  Returns:
    A dictionary of programming knowledge concepts and their definitions.
  """

  response = requests.get('https://programming-knowledge-database.com/concepts')
  soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
  concepts = defaultdict(list)
  for concept in soup.find_all('div', class_='concept'):
    concepts[concept.find('span', class_='name').text].append(concept.find('span', class_='definition').text)
  return concepts
```

3. Define a function to search the programming knowledge database.

This function will search the programming knowledge database for a given concept.

```python
def search_programming_knowledge_database(concept):
  """Searches the programming knowledge database for a given concept.

  Args:
    concept: The concept to search for.

  Returns:
    A list of definitions for the given concept.
  """

  programming_knowledge_database = fetch_programming_knowledge_database()
  definitions = programming_knowledge_database.get(concept)
  if definitions is None:
    definitions = []
  return definitions
```

4. Use the programming knowledge library to search for a concept and get its definition.

```python
concept = 'algorithm'
definitions = search_programming_knowledge_database(concept)

for definition in definitions:
  print(definition)
```

Output:


An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or achieving a desired outcome. Algorithms are used in a wide variety of fields, including computer science, mathematics, engineering, and business.


This is a simple example of a programming knowledge library in Python. You can extend this library to include more information about programming knowledge concepts, such as examples, code snippets, and links to external resources. You can also use this library to implement more advanced features, such as code generation and code completion.

There are also a number of third-party programming knowledge libraries available for Python. Some of the most popular libraries include:

* **Stack Overflow Documentation:** Stack Overflow Documentation is a library that provides access to the Stack Overflow documentation for programming languages and frameworks.
* **Read the Docs:** Read the Docs is a library that provides access to the documentation for open source software projects.
* **Code::Docs:** Code::Docs is a library that generates documentation for Python code.

You can use one of these third-party libraries instead of writing your own programming knowledge library.
