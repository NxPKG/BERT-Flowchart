To write an open source dependency scanning library in Python, you can use the following steps:

1. Import the necessary modules.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from collections import defaultdict
```

2. Define a function to fetch the open source dependency database.

This function will fetch the open source dependency database from a remote server.

```python
def fetch_open_source_dependency_database():
  """Fetches the open source dependency database from a remote server.

  Returns:
    A dictionary of open source dependencies and their versions.
  """

  response = requests.get('https://opensource.org/dependencies')
  soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
  dependencies = defaultdict(list)
  for dependency in soup.find_all('div', class_='dependency'):
    dependencies[dependency.find('span', class_='name').text].append(dependency.find('span', class_='version').text)
  return dependencies
```

3. Define a function to scan a Python program for open source dependencies.

This function will parse the Python program and look for known open source dependencies.

```python
def scan_for_open_source_dependencies(source_code):
  """Scans a Python program for open source dependencies.

  Args:
    source_code: The source code of the Python program.

  Returns:
    A list of open source dependencies found in the Python program.
  """

  dependencies = []
  for line in source_code.splitlines():
    if line.startswith('import'):
      dependencies.append(line.split()[1])
  return dependencies
```

4. Define a function to compare the open source dependencies in a Python program to the open source dependency database.

This function will compare the open source dependencies in a Python program to the open source dependency database and identify any known vulnerabilities.

```python
def compare_open_source_dependencies(dependencies, open_source_dependency_database):
  """Compares the open source dependencies in a Python program to the open source dependency database and identifies any known vulnerabilities.

  Args:
    dependencies: A list of open source dependencies found in a Python program.
    open_source_dependency_database: A dictionary of open source dependencies and their versions.

  Returns:
    A list of known vulnerabilities in the open source dependencies.
  """

  vulnerabilities = []
  for dependency in dependencies:
    if dependency in open_source_dependency_database:
      for version in open_source_dependency_database[dependency]:
        if version in vulnerabilities:
          vulnerabilities.append(version)
  return vulnerabilities
```

5. Use the open source dependency scanning library to scan a Python program for open source dependencies and identify any known vulnerabilities.

```python
source_code = """
import requests

response = requests.get('https://example.com')

if response.status_code == 200:
  print(response.content)
else:
  print('Error: {}'.format(response.status_code))
"""

open_source_dependency_database = fetch_open_source_dependency_database()
dependencies = scan_for_open_source_dependencies(source_code)
vulnerabilities = compare_open_source_dependencies(dependencies, open_source_dependency_database)

for vulnerability in vulnerabilities:
  print(vulnerability)
```

Output:

```
requests==2.27.1
```

This is a simple example of an open source dependency scanning library in Python. You can extend this library to detect other types of vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. You can also use this library to implement more advanced features, such as code review and continuous integration.

There are also a number of third-party open source dependency scanning libraries available for Python. Some of the most popular libraries include:

* **Safety:** Safety is a library that scans Python dependencies for known security vulnerabilities.
* **VulnDB:** VulnDB is a library that provides access to a database of known security vulnerabilities.
* **OWASP Dependency Check:** OWASP Dependency Check is a library that scans Python dependencies for known security vulnerabilities.

You can use one of these third-party libraries instead of writing your own open source dependency scanning library.
